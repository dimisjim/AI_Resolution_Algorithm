# AI_Resolution_Algorithm
AUEB AI Project

A resolution Algorithm implementation. It reads txt files with lines such as:
(ll OR l2) AND (NOT_l2): NOT_l1

(left-hand side stands for the KB, right-hand side for the to-be-infered alpha)

The application outputs all the results in one txt called results.txt and it creates also one txt for extensive results of each line
that it read.
